# Fourier transform Image Mixer
A program to mix and rebuild photos using different components
- use fourier transform to extract the magnitude, phase, real and imaginary plots of photos
- ability to upload multiple images and compare their plots
- mixing panel that allows users to choose which plot of wihch of the uploaded images to be mixed and specify a factor to each component
- several output displays with the ability to choose between them
- changes done to the component selection and their factors take effect live on the selected output display
- when mixing extra uniform phase and magnitude options are available that can act as a low pass or high pass filters to the images
